# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes apply to the current development revision and the latest
`1.0.x` patch release. Older snapshots and unsupported raw transport internals
do not receive backports.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Current development revision | Yes |
| Latest `1.0.x` release | Yes |
| Older tagged releases | No |
| Earlier snapshots | No |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue, pull request, discussion, or Autobahn report that
contains an undisclosed vulnerability.

Send a private report to
[trananhquan1009@gmail.com](mailto:trananhquan1009@gmail.com) or
[noah1109.tran@gmail.com](mailto:noah1109.tran@gmail.com). Include:

- the affected revision and target platform;
- a minimal reproducer or packet sequence;
- expected and observed behavior;
- impact and preconditions;
- logs or sanitizer output with secrets removed; and
- any suggested mitigation.

The maintainers will acknowledge the report, reproduce and assess it, prepare a
fix and regression test, and coordinate disclosure. Response time depends on
severity and maintainer availability; no fixed service-level agreement is
offered.

## Security boundaries

The live network surface is HTTP/1.1, bounded HTTP/2, RFC 6455 WebSockets,
RFC 7692 per-message deflate, HTTPS, and bounded HTTP/3 request/response
routing. HTTP/2 accepts plaintext prior knowledge or TLS ALPN and caps each
connection at eight streams. Raw QUIC engine, stream, packet, and QPACK
callbacks under `src/quic` are internal and are not a supported consumer
interface.

`http3_extensions` and `webtransport` provide bounded validators and wire
helpers. They are not connected to the live lsquic listener, which rejects
extended CONNECT; they do not establish WebTransport, server push, or
application-datagram support. RFC 10008 is the separate HTTP `QUERY` method
supported by the router. Live transports reject QUERY requests without a
syntactically valid `Content-Type` before the route handler runs.

Deployments must set connection, WebSocket message, write-queue, and HTTP/3
response capacities appropriate for their traffic, select an appropriate idle
timeout, and apply normal operating-system resource limits. The default idle
timeout is 120 seconds; `ConfiguredAppWithTimeout` can change it or disable
idle sweeping with zero. HTTP/3 additionally bounds decoded headers, request
bodies, packet buffers, connections, and active streams.

Parameterized routing stores at most 16 borrowed captures per request and 64
patterns per router. Global middleware is capped at 32 entries. Asynchronous
response tokens are generation-checked and one-shot; they are confined to the
owning event loop, invalidate on transport reuse, and must not be completed
from another thread without first marshalling work to that loop.

Per-message deflate is disabled by default. When enabled, negotiation requires
client and server no-context-takeover, compressed input and output use separate
caller-owned scratch slices, and decompression cannot exceed the configured
message capacity. An 8-bit server compression window is declined because zlib
cannot emit it reliably; incoming 8-bit client streams retain the same
decompression bound.

Request and WebSocket message slices are borrowed from fixed connection
storage. Request and parameter slices remain valid until a synchronous handler
returns or its asynchronous token completes; WebSocket message slices remain
valid only for their callback. The application value itself must remain at a
stable address after `listen` or `listen_udp`.

The C ABI in `include/uWebZockets.h` uses opaque handles and copied route paths,
but returned `uwz_slice` values are still borrowed. Applications must destroy
opaque handles explicitly and handle every nonzero `uwz_error`. Copy request
fields and route parameters into caller-owned storage before a C callback
returns if asynchronous work needs them. Copy async tokens, marshal completion
to the owning event loop, and complete each generation at most once.

The project uses bounded buffers and protocol compliance tests to reduce risk,
but these controls do not guarantee the absence of defects. Consumers should
pin exact source or release hashes, review `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and test
the library under their own workload before production deployment.

Application teardown is completion-driven: stop accepting new work, cancel and
drain registered libxev operations, then release TLS, QUIC, event-loop, and slab
storage. Consumers should call `deinit` through `defer` and must not copy or move
an `App` after `listen` or `listen_udp` has registered callbacks.

CI runs the centralized Zig and C ABI graph with ASan, UBSan, and leak
detection on native Linux while instrumenting the pinned C/C++ dependencies
and local C shim. A separate, mutually exclusive x86_64 Linux
MemorySanitizer job rebuilds those C/C++ components with origin tracking and
executes a focused dependency-boundary smoke. It does not claim MSan
instrumentation of Zig code or full C ABI behavior. Google
OSS-Fuzz/libFuzzer entrypoints exercise HTTP
framing, WebSocket masking, and QUIC/WebTransport packet boundaries; local
deterministic smoke seeds are retained. Autobahn, h1spec, and the pinned
curl/ngtcp2 plus aioquic HTTP/3 gate add protocol coverage. Deployments should
still perform workload-specific QUIC load testing.

Cross-platform support covers Linux, macOS, Windows (`x86_64-windows-gnu` /
MinGW ABI), FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFlyBSD. The configured publish
matrix covers Linux and macOS. A dedicated native Windows job compiles the
complete ReleaseSafe test/ABI graph without executing it, and tagged
releases include its static libraries. Windows runtime verification remains a
Tier 2 deployment responsibility. The additional BSD targets share the build
graph without dedicated runtime CI coverage.

## Disclosure

Please allow a reasonable remediation and release window before publication.
Security advisories will credit reporters who request attribution and will
describe affected versions, impact, and upgrade guidance without exposing
unnecessary exploit detail before a fix is available.
